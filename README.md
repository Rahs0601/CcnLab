Networking Protocols and Algorithms
This repository contains implementation and analysis of various networking protocols and algorithms using C++. The tasks and learning outcomes covered in this repository are as follows:

Implementation and Analysis
Implement a point-to-point network with four nodes and duplex links between them, and analyze the network performance by setting the queue size and varying the bandwidth.
Implement a four-node point-to-point network with links n0-n2, nl-n2, and n2-n3, and apply TCP and UDP agents between no-n3. Test the performance by applying relevant applications over the TCP and UDP agents and changing the parameters.
Implement an Ethernet LAN with 6-10 nodes, and compare the throughput by changing the error rate and data rate.
Implement an Ethernet LAN with n nodes, and assign multiple traffic to the nodes. Obtain congestion window for different sources/destinations.
Implement a wireless LAN and obtain the performance parameters.
Routing Algorithms
Implement the link state routing algorithm.
Implement the distance vector routing algorithm to find suitable paths for transmission.
Implement Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest routing path.
Error Detection and Correction
Use the CRC-CCITT polynomial to obtain a CRC code for the given data.
Verify the program for the cases without error and with error.
Reliable Data Transmission Protocols
Implement the stop-and-wait protocol.
Implement the sliding window protocol.
Other
Write a program to perform bit stuffing and character stuffing using an I-ILDC frame.
Write a program for congestion control using the leaky bucket algorithm.
Prerequisites
Before running the code in this repository, make sure you have the following installed:

A C++ compiler, such as GCC or Clang
Any required libraries or modules, such as Boost (these will be specified in the code if they are needed)
Running the code
To run the code in this repository, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using git https://github.com/Rahs0601/CcnLab.git
